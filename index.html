    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
   <div class= "hobbies">
    <p> Here are some of my hobbies
      <ol>
          <li> Reading Novels and poems - I am a big fan of literary works my favourite novelist is <a href= "https://g.co/kgs/tSN6CX"> Sydney Sheldon</a></li>
          <li>Binge watching movies - I dont know if this counts as a hobby or an addiction but I do enjoy tormenting my photoreceptors to endless series on Netlix.</li>
          <li>planting - this one sounds weird but I am obsessed with planting any and all types of seeds. Currently as I am making this List I have over six variety of seeds that am growing on my balcony from cherry tomatoes to watermelons and even <em>Maize!</em></li>
          <li>Music - If someone could marry something  that isn't a human being for once I'd litrally marry Music. </li>
          <li>writing poems - I think am addicted to writing down my everyday thoughts and turning them into poems. This really became a habit since I started reading poetic master pieces in my pre-teens.Among the many talented poets I admire I think currently <a href= "https://rupikaur.com/">Rupi Kaur</a>is my favourite. Am saying <strong>currently</strong>because the list of genius poets is just too many to settle for just one poet. </li>
          <li>Travelling and Driving - I geuss this two go hand in hand . I mean if I can't Travel I just like going for long drives</li>
          <li>Eating</li>
      </ol>
